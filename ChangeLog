and throttles map pings more aggressively which should continue to help with
message flood problems.

2018-06-29 (v3.21)

- Fix countdown hotkey (apparently no one uses this).

- Reinstate method for only sending ult percentages when they change. It's needed to send quest requests.

- Consider player "live" whenever they ping rather than whenever there is a ping for ultimate. Should help with players

- Make ultimate alerts display the actual ultimate fired rather than the main one selected

2018-03-16 (v3.1)

2018-03-16 (v3.0)

- Optimize LUA code to avoid potential excess memory use.

- The ultimate control will now always be movable. That red background thing will show up briefly when you drag the window to a new location. Type "/pocmovable off" if this behavior is not to your liking.

- When someone fires an ultimate it will show up onscreen for everyone as, e.g., "Valandil Tiwele's FREEZE".

- You'll be able to specify a second ultimate by selecting the thumbs-up with a "2" on it. That cause that ultimate to show up as a different color in that column.

(I'm still tinkering with this so some things may not work right. Most notably - if I put meteor on my bar and then use the ultimate, the on-screen message will say "Valandil's FREEZE" rather than "Valandil's METEOR".

Also, the sorting for secondary ultimates in columns will be different. It will be more like the way the old Taos add-on sorted things. I don't think this should be a big problem since secondary ultimates are either supposed to be temporary or just there for informational purposes like when someone has both Dawnbreaker and Permafrost available)

- It will be possible to automatically share the Chalman mine and keep quests. When you turn in your chal quest, you'll get it back almost immediately if anyone else in the group has it. This feature is controlled in the settings window and via the "/pocquest off" command.

- The add-on notifies when someone is running a new version. Then you'll know it's time to update.

2018-02-25 (v2.3.3)

- Hopefully fix real problem with non-English client.s

2018-02-21 (v2.3.2)

- Overwrite (temporarily?) French translations with English to avoid lua errors.

2018-02-19 (v2.3.1)

- Eliminate need for everyone to be in the same map/zone.
- Eliminate misbehaving LibGroupSocket (for now?).
- Save group content over /reloadui.
- Fix a few bugs related to screen refresh when players go offline and back online.

2018-02-12 (v2.2.0)

- Updated supported API to include Dragon Bones, update 17
- Added new method for selecting your ultimate: Click on one of the column (swimlane) icons and then click on the thumbs-up to switch your ultimate to that lane. Use icons to select columns rather than words.
- Added back ability to use libgroupsocket, currently only available via the command "/pocping false"
- Tinkered more with the number notifier and sound notifier to try to make it actually accurate.

- Hopefully fix rare case where out-of-contact player would incorrectly assume another player's group ultimate.

2018-02-08 (v2.1.4)

2018-02-07 (v2.1.3)

- Fix reported issue of lua error when changing group icon in compact mode.

2018-02-06 (v2.1.2)

2018-01-21 (v2.0.2)

* Hopefully fix confusion with player numbering when group membership changes. This may fix the issue seen where numbers displayed are incorrect.
* There is still an issue with numbering disparity between different players after zoning. Numbers should sync eventually after users cycle their ultimates as long as they are in the same map.

2018-01-19 (v2.0.1)

* Add back "Compact" mode
* Remove ultimate number when dead
* Color ultimate number green when #1, red when not #1
